# TomBot    

TomBot is a chat bot built on the \[Hubot\]\[hubot\] framework, designed to bring the songs of \[Stevie Wonder\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_Wonder) to your SlackBot. To help understand TomBot a little better, here is a little taster of what it can do:    

### Sing from a list of 5 Wonder classics    

Listening in the background to your conversations, should you ever mention anything song related, Stevie will just interrupt with link to one of classics.    

Impatient and just want to understand our starting trigger words?   

    sing / song / singing / voice   

### But you're missing my favorite song?    

Don't panic! We are starting with a playlist of only 5 hits, but you can add to this. Just type the below followed by your song link to be added to the playlist:   

    add this to your playlist  

### How can I keep track of my playlist?  

Adding too many songs can get confusing, so if you want to understand what is on the current playlist just type the below:   

    what's my playlist   

### Does Stevie Wonder ever get tired from singing?  

Yes! After singing through the first 5 songs for you, he may get a little tired. Don't be surprised to see the message:  
    
    I've sung too much, taking a break. Try again later.

I'm sure if you ask again, he will start singing again ... if you ask enough times!
  
### Before we start, how do I say hello?

    hi / hello
